        <h2>Things I Love about You</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You farted on me... It smelt like death</li>
            <li>You make me happy</li>
            <li>You complete me</li>
            <li>You never poop</li>
            <li>You eat your soft shell tacos weird</li>

        <h2>The poem that reminds me of you...</h2>
        <p>
            somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond<br>
            any experience, your eyes have their silence:<br>
            in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,<br>
            or which i cannot touch because they are too near<br><br>

            your slightest look easily will unclose me<br>
            though i have closed myself as fingers,<br>
            you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens<br>
            (touching skillfully, mysteriously) her first rose<br><br>

            or if your wish be to close me, i and<br>
            my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,<br>
            as when the heart of this flower imagines<br>
            the snow carefully everywhere descending;<br><br>

            nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals<br>
            the power of your intense fragility: whose texture<br>
            compels me with the colour of its countries,<br>
            rendering death and forever with each breathing<br><br>

            (i do not know what it is about you that closes<br>
            and opens; only something in me understands<br>
            the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)<br>
            nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands<br>
        </p>
